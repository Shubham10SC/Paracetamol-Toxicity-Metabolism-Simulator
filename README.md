### 🏥 Overview
A high-performance hybrid application that simulates the hepatotoxic effects of Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) overdose. 

This project demonstrates **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** by combining:
*   **C++ (Backend):** Handles complex kinetic calculations and liver depletion logic for maximum speed.
*   **Python (Frontend):** Uses Streamlit and RDKit for molecular visualization and interactive UI.

### 🧬 Key Features
*   **Real-time Metabolism Tracking:** Simulates the conversion of Paracetamol to the toxic metabolite **NAPQI**.
*   **Glutathione (GSH) Depletion:** Models the liver's defense mechanism against toxins using decay algorithms.
*   **Molecular Visualization:** Renders 2D chemical structures of Paracetamol and NAPQI dynamically.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Calculates toxic load scores to predict liver failure risks.

### 🚀 Installation & Usage

Since this project uses a custom C++ engine, you must compile the backend before running the app.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham10SC/Paracetamol-Toxicity-Metabolism-Simulator.git
cd Paracetamol-Toxicity-Metabolism-Simulator
